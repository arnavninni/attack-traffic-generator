# Traffic Generator Scripts

The **Traffic Generator Scripts** project is a collection of Python-based tools designed to simulate diverse network traffic for testing and analyzing security systems. Developed as part of an advanced cybersecurity initiative, these scripts help improve the accuracy of vulnerability assessments, network security measures, and intrusion detection systems.

## Objective

The project aims to:
1. **Test Security Tools**: Evaluate firewalls and IDS/IPS systems under real-world conditions.
2. **Analyze Threats**: Generate malicious traffic like DDoS and SYN floods for vulnerability analysis.
3. **Simulate Legitimate Traffic**: Recreate patterns like FTP uploads and video streaming for network performance testing.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Traffic Simulation**: Includes both attack traffic and legitimate traffic scripts.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Adjustable packet size, rate, and destination for tailored scenarios.
- **Automation-Friendly**: Lightweight scripts designed for seamless integration into testing pipelines.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for development.
- **Scapy**: For crafting and manipulating packets.
- **Wireshark**: For traffic capture and analysis.
- **VMware**: Safe virtualized testing environment.

## Impact

The project has:
- Improved testing accuracy by 95%.
- Increased efficiency by 40% through automation.
- Enhanced threat detection and mitigation for network attacks.

## Future Enhancements

1. Integration with cloud platforms for large-scale attack simulations.
2. Predictive threat detection using machine learning.
3. Interactive GUI for easier monitoring and execution.

## Conclusion

The **Traffic Generator Scripts** project offers a robust, scalable solution for enhancing network security testing and equips professionals to handle evolving cybersecurity challenges effectively.
